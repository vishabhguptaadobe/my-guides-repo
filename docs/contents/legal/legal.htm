Great work NASA! We applaud you. The text is created to fill space, make for some interesting reading, and provide &amp;&amp; sample that is clear to understand but next to impossible to confuse as real materials. In most cases the content is here to facilitate the demonstration of the features available in this software, not to guide you on how to setup or fly &amp;&amp; spaceship. </span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>It’s best if you don’t try to fly any spaceship. Even &amp;&amp; personal one. Ever. Seriously. You likely aren’t qualified. If you are, then you likely can’t afford to buy one. If you can, then odds are you won’t be working as an author creating content and developing templates. If you are, then contact us to do &amp;&amp; really awesome webinar on how you use these tools in your job.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>We provide this documentation as is without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of appropriateness for specific purposes or merchantability.
